## üòè objective:
<p align='Justify'>
This tutorial aims to give a simplistic view of the selenium library, to show that with few codes it is possible to manipulate a web page and for that, we will use Anaconda as a development environment.
<p/>

## What is selenium ‚ùì
<p align='Justify'>
Selenium is a lib that allows you to define tests and automatically detect the results of those tests in a preferred browser. A set of Selenium functions makes it possible to create step-by-step interactions with a web page, simulating a normal user of the system.
<a href='https://www.browserstack.com/guide/python-selenium-to-run-web-automation-test'>[1]<a/>
<p/>
 
## üíø How to install:
<p align='Justify'>
To install Selenium just run in this way the library will be downloaded to your Anaconda environment: <br>
<p/>

~~~python
pip install selenium
~~~

## üìö Necessary Imports:


>Expects a certain process.
~~~python
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
~~~
>Import web page settings.
~~~python
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
~~~
>Send keyboard commands (enter, f1, f2,...,f12).
~~~python
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
~~~
>Import the browser to be used.
~~~python
from selenium.webdriver import Firefox
~~~
>Import drive settings.
~~~python
from selenium import webdriver
~~~
>Time-oriented module (calendar, hours, minutes, seconds ...).
~~~python
import time
~~~
>We will use this item to hide password (optional).
~~~python
import getpass 
~~~

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting settings to open the web page:
<p align='Justify'>
As we will apply this study using instagram as a base, obviously we will use its link in the url field and soon after, we will save the settings to be set later.
<p/>

>The URL variable takes the page address.
~~~python
url = "https://www.instagram.com"
~~~
>We keep all available options in the OPTION variable.
~~~python
option = Options()
~~~
<p align='Justify'>
At this point, it is important to download the browser drivers that we will be using so that selenium can work and as we will be using Firefox for this tutorial we will download the <a href='https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases'><b>Gekodriver</b><a/>, for more information on this read the <a href='https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started_with_webdriver/browsers/'><b>documentation</b><a/>.
<p/>
- That done, so that we can visualize the whole process happening, it is important to set the value False to handler.


>We set False on handless to show the process on the web page.
~~~python
option.headless = False
~~~
>Opens the browser tab.
~~~python
driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=option)
~~~

<p align='Justify'>
As instagram is a responsive site, depending on the size of the screen it uses different classes, so that work is easier we will set up settings for the size and position of the web page.
<p/>

>We set the browser screen size.
~~~python
driver.set_window_size(448,708)
~~~
>We define the position of the browser window.
~~~python
driver.set_window_position(800,200)
~~~
>Send the instagram url to the driver, who will send an order to the browser to access the site.
~~~python
driver.get(url)
~~~

So far this has been the result obtained: <br>

<p/>


## üîí(***) Setting username and password:

<p align="justify">
Now we need to identify the User and Password field names directly in the browser so that we can later set our users, passwords and create a timeout for them.
<p/>
This can be easily resolved by pressing F12 to see the source code of the page.

<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82558320-c812a280-9b43-11ea-9c0d-aec58d9e037a.PNG' width='40%'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82558322-c8ab3900-9b43-11ea-8a61-74644cc5e0f3.PNG' width='38%'>
<p/>

Let's first define a function that will do a search for the element "username", for that we use find_element_by_name ("username"), which looks for HTML tags by name:


~~~python
def esperar_campo(firefox):
  return driver.find_element_by_name("username")
~~~

<p align='Justify'>
Then, we will use WebDriverWait (driver, 5), DRIVER the settings of the web page and choose 5s as the waiting time if the function "hold_field ()" returns successfully:
<p/>

~~~python
carregando = WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(esperar_campo)
~~~

And finally, we will complete the username and password fields:
<br>
For that, and we will use the functions

   - driver.find_element_by_name() -> Find the specified field with the name.
   - clear() -> Delete any data that is contained in the field.
   - send_keys() -> Send the string to the found field.
    

Staying as follows for the user field.

>Insert user data in the field.

~~~python
name_campo = driver.find_element_by_name("username")
name_campo.clear()
name_campo.send_keys("Coloque aqui o seu usu√°rio")
~~~

The same is repeated for the password field.

>Enter password in the field.

~~~python
senha_campo = driver.find_element_by_name("password")
senha_campo.clear()
senha_campo.send_keys("Coloque aqui a sua senha")
~~~
And finally press ENTER to enter instagram

~~~python
senha_campo.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
~~~

<h4> In this way, we were able to obtain the following result: <h4/>

<br>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82576316-16ce3580-9b60-11ea-826a-2379f22ad601.gif' width='20%'>

## ‚ùó Retirar notifica√ß√£o:

<p align='Justify'>
With the result above we can see the appearance of a JavaScript window that will appear whenever instagram is opened for the first time in the session. Selenium has methods for closing windows <a href='https://www.techbeamers.com/handle-alert-popup-selenium-python/'> (you can check more here) <a/>, however, let's see how do this using the functions we've used so far.

Initially, we need to get the window references because we are going to use xpath, which is nothing more than a set of syntax rules to define parts of an XML document, to select it and store it in variables. <a href='http://www.macoratti.net/vb_xpath.htm'> [2] <a/>
<p/>

<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82602072-e352d180-9b86-11ea-8e2f-02762d23d2e8.PNG' width='40%'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82603081-6d4f6a00-9b88-11ea-952c-a57bcc5cd999.PNG' width='39.5%'>
<p/>

>These are variables that I will need, they bring information from the page code!
~~~python
dialog_box = "//div[@class='piCib']"
button_dialog_box = "//button[@class='aOOlW   HoLwm ']"
~~~

After that, we will create a function similar to the *** esper_campo () *** function, and it will be called *** awa_dialog () *** and will return a response when the dialog box loads.

>Function to wait for a response, if the dialog box is still not found, and wait 5s after being found.

~~~python
def espera_dialog(firefox):
  return driver.find_element_by_xpath(dialog_box)
~~~

>Wait until the ***hold_dialog()*** function returns a result, meaning that the dialog box has loaded.

~~~python
esperando_jane_dialog = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(espera_dialog)
~~~

>A click is given on the button ***"Not now"***.

~~~python
driver.find_element_by_xpath(button_dialog_box).click()
~~~

<p/>

## üëÄ View Story's:
As already seen, the first step is to get the address of the button to access the storys and soon after, the button to pass the story.

<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82616860-d1802700-9ba4-11ea-9245-dc6581b51978.gif' width='30%'>
<br>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82691749-c5dc4100-9c34-11ea-804f-2b8f1c41eefd.png' width='44.3%'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82691745-c4ab1400-9c34-11ea-855e-89ab41d7bdd8.png' width='40.594%'>
<p/>


<p align="justify">
In tests, two classes were found for the buttons we need, <b> class='jZyv1  H-yu6' and @class='OE3OK ' </b>, such classes change according to the size of the screen. Therefore, we will take both to work even if we don‚Äôt need it since we created a screen 448x708 which means that we can only use the <b> @class='OE3OK ' </b>.
<p/>

>I keep the size of the available screens in variables.

~~~python
window_big = "//button[@class='jZyv1  H-yu6']"
window_little = "//button[@class='OE3OK ']"
~~~

Selenium has a method called Click () used, as the name implies, to click on an element. We will use this method to open the storys.

~~~python
# Procedure: Press to open a story
def open_story ():
    try:
     #Reduced Screen
     driver.find_element_by_xpath(window_little).click()
    except:
     #Maximized Screen  
     driver.find_element_by_xpath(window_big).click()
~~~
Now, we have a button that we can use to open the storys:

>We call the open_story function()

~~~python
open_story()
~~~

<p align="justify">
Now, why don't we create a function to go through the storys while the story window is open?
It may seem totally useless, but for some people and jobs it can prove to be useful.
For that, we take the reference to the story page to know when or not we are inside a story and the pass button seen previously.<p/>

>Tell if the stories are still open.

~~~python
window_story ="//section[@class='_8XqED  carul']"
~~~

>It is the address of the button to pass the story

~~~python
button_story_pass ="//button[@class='ow3u_']"
~~~

We created a loop that directly receives the value True, to do the process indefinitely.
<br>
That's what our code is saying:
<br>
>*"While Truth, while you have an open story try to press the button to pass and wait 2 seconds, if it fails try to wait 1.5 seconds and try to pass the story again, if it fails, refresh the web page and then wait 8 seconds to open the stories again."* 

~~~python
while(True):
    try:
        while(driver.find_element_by_xpath(window_story)):
            driver.find_element_by_xpath(button_story_pass).click()
            time.sleep(2)
    except Exception as e:
        try:
            time.sleep(1.5)
            driver.find_element_by_xpath(button_story_pass).click()
        except Exception as e:
            driver.refresh()
            time.sleep(8)
            open_story()
~~~


**This is the result of the running program:**

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Automatically like posts on instagram:
<i>This feature is contributed by <a href='https://github.com/luisERH'>luisERH<a/>.</i><br>
For this functionality we need to understand a little better how instagram works.
<br>

- All publications are inside a flexbox.

<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82713199-83c8f480-9c60-11ea-9097-c0aa20f7fc36.PNG' width='80%'>
<p/>

- And each post is inside an article.


<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82713519-9db70700-9c61-11ea-9371-a002d6be0931.png' width='80%'>
<p/>

<p align="justify"> 
Therefore, it is necessary to describe the path to be followed until reaching the button to be clicked. For this, we will use a browser feature and to use it just select with the right mouse button the line to which we want to get the address.
<p/>

<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82713272-c68acc80-9c60-11ea-8108-29006c609dbc.png' width='80%'>
<p/>

By doing this, we achieve the following result:
To learn more about Selectors Css <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child'>clique aqui<a/>

~~~css
article._8Rm4L:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(3) > section:nth-child(1) > span:nth-child(1) > button:nth-child(1)
~~~

<p align="justify">
But in this way, we will be able to select only the first result every 8 or 9 elements and it is not what we want. To resolve this impasse, we need to specify more which element we want to select, and in this case it is all the elements that are not tanned.
We can see below that an element changes depending on the state of the publication:
<p/>

<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82716761-8f6fe780-9c6f-11ea-8f00-5379b542121a.png' width='80%'>
<p/>

Therefore, we need to insert this condition in our code, being as follows:

~~~python
article._8Rm4L:nth-child(1n) > div:nth-child(3) > section:nth-child(1) > span:nth-child(1) > button:nth-child(1) > svg:nth-child(1)[aria-label='Curtir']
~~~

<p align="justify">
Now, let's create a function called <b> Likes_publicacoes() </b> with a <b> Try Catch </b> to like the found elements and in case of any exception, we use the <b> PASS </b> attribute which means to pass, that is, to let the occurrence pass.
<p/>

~~~python
def curte_publicacoes():
    try:
        driver.find_element_by_css_selector("article._8Rm4L:nth-child(1n) > div:nth-child(3) > section:nth-child(1) > span:nth-child(1) > button:nth-child(1) > svg:nth-child(1)[aria-label='Curtir']").click()
    except Exception as e:
        pass
~~~

<p align="justify">
And finally, we created a While with the value True, to run it indefinitely, inside, we will create an accumulator called aux (auxiliary), which will grow by 100 with each complete lap. We will use selenium's Script manipulation function (driver.execute_script()) to manipulate the page's scroll roll, and for that we will use a script function that can be called like this -> window.scrollTo (Horizontal, Vertical), and then then we will call the function created earlier, leaving the code as follows:
<p/>

~~~python
#From page
aux = 1
while(True):
    aux += 100
    driver.execute_script(f'window.scrollTo(0,{aux})')
    curte_publicacoes()            
~~~

- The final result:

<p align="center">
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42920754/82489811-9e606980-9ab8-11ea-93f2-ffed391c5c37.gif' width='30%'>
<p/>

## üéØ Upcoming updates:
- "When you reach the page border, refresh page".
- OBS: The code is very simple and due to this it ends up having some bugs.
